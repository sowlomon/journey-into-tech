                    i am 22 years old, i am a Nigerian and a student of kaduna polytechnic studying computer engineering
                    at the <i>HND</i>
                    level.
                    i want to become a software engineer after graduating so i am working really hard to get the
                    necessary
                    skills i require
                    to become a good developer.I am going to talk a little about how i fell in love with

            <h2><font size="4">HOW I FELL IN LOVE WITH TECH</font></h2>
            <p>It all started when i was in primary 4,i fell in love with the computer system though i never had one at
                that
                time
                but all thanks to my dad who is a computer scientist, he introduced me to computers, through him i saw
                some
                cool
                things i could do with the computer system including playing<q>games</q> of course, lol ,my dad always
                took i
                and my siblings to his office and gave us access to his computer system through which i learnt about
                microsoft
                word, i also learnt how to draw using paint tool and so on,he took tutorials for some students on
                microsoft
                word, so most times i do assist him with the students which made his work easier.
            <p>After learning much about computers through my dad it helped me so much because i offered computer
                science while
                in primary school then and at the end of my study in primary school, i came out the best in computer
                science at this point i
                knew
                that this was for me, but i wanted to become an architect when i grew up at that time but i still had so
                much
                love
                for the computer.
            <p>To cut the long story short after graduating from secondary school in 2016 i applied for
                architecture
                in
                ABU(Ahmadu bello university) but i did not get the admission all thanks to God that i already applied to
                study
                computer
                engineering in kaduna polytechnic,i was given the admission and here i am in HND now i guess it was all
                <q>God's
                    plan</q> because i have no regrets at all.
                It was during my ND1 in school that i first learnt about programming then we were being taught FOTRAN
                programming
                language i never understood that language as at the time but i managed to pass the course, after my ND1
                we were
                sent out
                for
                industrial experience(SIWES) it was then every thing changed i found my love "coding".There i was sent
                to the
                computer repairs department because i studied computer engineering but they also had a computer
                programming
                department that taught programming,i decided to visit the department to see what they were doing,there i
                met a
                young
                boy,
                i cant really remember his name though, i saw him scrolling through a web page(a very beautiful web
                page) then
                i picked interest and asked him what web page was that, he looked at me and said its the web page he
                created,i
                was amazed,
                he showed me how he created the web page with the codes he wrote it was then i fell in love with
                programming.
                I picked interest because i am a very creative person and i love creative processes,though i never
                really
                went deep into programming at that time because i never had a system,so after i graduated from
                ND(national
                diploma)
                i
                went on for my 1 year I.T(industrial training) during this period i worked with nigerian breweries(NB)
                after my
                1
                year I.T my dad got me a computer system that was towards the end of 2019,and by 2020 i was to resume
                back to
                continue
                my schooling(HND) which i did, this was the year the corana virus struck and i left school to come back
                home.

                While i was home i promised my self that i was going to learn more about programming, i made a lot of
                research
                and
                found
                out that python was the best language to start with as a beginner so i downloaded lots of python
                tutorials from
                scratch and i started learning the fundamentals of programming after about 5 months of learning i was
                able to
                work on three projects with the help of tutorial videos.Some of the projects i worked on are listed
                below:</p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><b>A Fashion Website(using Django frame work)</b></li>
                <li><b>A Guessing Game </b></li>
                <li><b>A Program To Automate Excel spread-Sheet</b></li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>All the above projects were done using python programming language.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You can find this projects on my Github account</p> <b><a href="http://www.github.com/sowlomon"
                                                                         target="blank"
                                                                         class="hove">https://github.com/sowlomon</a></b>
            <br>
            <p>I wanted to venture into web development(frontend then later backend) so i had to seek for advice from
                experienced
                developers,
                and i was advised to go learn more on Html,Css and javascript which i am currently on and after some
                time i am
                pretty confident with
                Html and Css but i am still learning(for a developer learning never ends).My next step is to learn
                javascript
                and its
                frame work.
            <p>My goal is that before the end of 2021 i should be comfortable with this languages and land my first
                job
                in tech,its a big goal right? yeah i know,lol,but i believe that with hard work i can achieve anything.
            <p>Hopefully this
                explains
                how
                i fell in love with Tech,i am not a very good writer yet, still learning(pardon my mistakes
                "lol").Thanks for your time and God bless.I sill
                remain
                SOLOMON
